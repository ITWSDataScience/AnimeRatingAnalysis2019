## General Introduction
Anime, the Japanese term for animation, is a type of art in the format of hand-drawn or computer animation made in or associated with Japan. The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917, and Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily. Severing people with virtual characters and dramatic plots, there is not doubt that the existance of animation brought human's imagination to the next level. Japanâ€™s anime industry was worth 2.1527 trillion yen ($20 billion) in 2017, topping 2 trillion yen for the first time and marking the fifth straight record high, the Association of Japanese Animations (AJA) said. However, it is impssibile for the society to ignore the problems brought by its popularity in both Japan and worldwide.

One of the problems is caused by largely produced animes. Whith the growth of the market, the number of animes produced is accumulating rapidly. However, audience is having a harder time finding an anime they would like to watch with more and more animes are getting produced every year. According to a report conducted by The Association of Japanese Animations(AJA) in 2018, the market recorded 108% growth and the highest sales in 2017. The year 2017 was the first year that the Japanese animation market crossed the 2 trillion yen mark. It is not hard for us to realize the fact this industry is increasingly growing. However, the massively produced contents alos put audience in an award situation. Although there are tousands of animes, TV series, and anime movies produce every year, good portion of users are still conplaining about not having anime that they enjoy watching. In other words, it is of great importance to have a recommendation engine, which can help audience find proper content for them.
